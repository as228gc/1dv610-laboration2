I had method names like filterTransactionsByCategory, in this case i changed the methods name to filterByCategory because the modules main responsibility is to handle an array of transactions and therefore I do not have to use it in every name of the methods. The results is a shorter and understandable method name, which leads to more readable code.

The variable names I chose are sometimes repetetive and appear in multiple different methods. This could make searchability for specific varaibles harder as there are several results. Variables liek transaction, income, and expense are used throughout the module.

Refering to the book Clean Code, it says that you should not use the word "Processor" in a class name. In this module I have created a class called TransactionProcessor, which clearly includes the word "Processor". In this case, the only responsibility of the class is to handle an array of transactions, and in my eyes that is a useful name to understand what the class is used for. Although I could have changed the naming of this class to follow the recommendations of the book, I think that the current naming is not horrible but could of course be improved.
